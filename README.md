## 📝 Description
In India, where agriculture forms the backbone of the economy and supports the livelihoods of millions, integrating cutting-edge computer science technologies is no longer optional—it’s a necessity. This project aims to enhance farmers’ productivity and profitability by simplifying agricultural workflows through intelligent and accessible software solutions.

At the heart of our mission is the belief that agriculture is not just a profession but a crucial driver of national economic growth. By harnessing the potential of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), we seek to transform traditional farming practices into data-driven, optimized, and scalable systems. Our goal is to offer solutions that can predict crop diseases, suggest suitable fertilizers, and provide real-time recommendations—all tailored to the unique conditions of Indian agriculture.

This project bridges the gap between technological innovation and rural empowerment, ensuring that advanced AI models are translated into tools that farmers can actually use. Whether through mobile interfaces, web apps, or embedded systems, our solutions aim to empower farmers with timely insights, minimize losses, and maximize crop yield.

## ⏳ Dataset 

Our project utilizes three key datasets sourced from Kaggle, each supporting a specific model: fertilizer recommendation, crop selection, and disease identification. These datasets are crucial for training accurate, real-world AI solutions tailored for agriculture.

🌾 1. Fertilizer Recommendation Dataset
Purpose:
To recommend the most suitable fertilizer based on soil and environmental conditions.

Features:

🧪 N – Nitrogen content in soil

🧪 P – Phosphorous content in soil

🧪 K – Potassium content in soil

🌡️ Temperature – Ambient temperature (°C)

💧 Humidity – Relative humidity (%)

🌱 Moisture – Soil moisture level (%)

🌾 Crop Type – Name of the crop

🏞️ Soil Type – Type of soil (e.g., sandy, loamy)

Usage:
Used for building custom fertilizer recommendation models that enhance soil productivity.

🌱 2. Crop Recommendation Dataset
Purpose:
To identify the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil nutrients and climate factors.

Features:

🧪 N, P, K – Macronutrient values in soil

🌡️ Temperature – Temperature in °C

💧 Humidity – Humidity percentage

⚗️ pH – Soil pH level

🌧️ Rainfall – Annual rainfall in millimeters

Usage:
Trained models help farmers decide the best crop to cultivate under given environmental conditions.

🍃 3. Disease Identification Dataset
Purpose:
To detect plant diseases using image classification with deep learning models.

Dataset Details:

🖼️ 87,000+ RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves

📂 38 classes – Each representing a crop-disease pair

🔄 80/20 split for training and validation

🔬 33 test images reserved for real-time prediction validation

🗂️ Structured in directories for easy image loading and model training
