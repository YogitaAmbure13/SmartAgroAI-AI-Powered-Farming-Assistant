## üìù Description
In India, where agriculture forms the backbone of the economy and supports the livelihoods of millions, integrating cutting-edge computer science technologies is no longer optional‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity. This project aims to enhance farmers‚Äô productivity and profitability by simplifying agricultural workflows through intelligent and accessible software solutions.

At the heart of our mission is the belief that agriculture is not just a profession but a crucial driver of national economic growth. By harnessing the potential of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), we seek to transform traditional farming practices into data-driven, optimized, and scalable systems. Our goal is to offer solutions that can predict crop diseases, suggest suitable fertilizers, and provide real-time recommendations‚Äîall tailored to the unique conditions of Indian agriculture.

This project bridges the gap between technological innovation and rural empowerment, ensuring that advanced AI models are translated into tools that farmers can actually use. Whether through mobile interfaces, web apps, or embedded systems, our solutions aim to empower farmers with timely insights, minimize losses, and maximize crop yield.

## ‚è≥ Dataset 

In this project to train the machine learning and Deep Learning models we have taken datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). 

### 1.Fertilizer Recommendation Dataset
This dataset contains essential parameters for fertilizer recommendation models, aiding in the optimization of crop yield and soil health. The dataset includes the following fields:

    N: Ratio of Nitrogen content in soil

    P: Ratio of Phosphorous content in soil

    K: Ratio of Potassium content in soil

    Temperature: Temperature in degrees Celsius

    Humidity: Relative humidity in percentage

    Moisture: Moisture level in percentage

    Crop Type: Name of the crop

    Soil Type: Type of the soil

### 2.Crop  Recommendation Dataset
This dataset serves as a valuable resource for crop recommendation systems, aiding in the selection of optimal crops based on various soil and environmental factors. The dataset comprises the following essential fields:

    N: Ratio of Nitrogen content in soil
    
    P: Ratio of Phosphorous content in soil

    K: Ratio of Potassium content in soil

    Temperature: Temperature in degrees Celsius

    Humidity: Relative humidity in percentage

    pH: pH value of the soil

    Rainfall: Rainfall in millimeters

 ### 3.Disease Identification Dataset
This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset. This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes. The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure. A directory containing 33 test images is created for prediction purpose.
